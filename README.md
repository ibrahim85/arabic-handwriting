# arabic-handwriting
Application of MNIST techniques to Arabic handwriting, mainly using Pytorch or the fast.ai 1.0 library

First attempt adapted from https://medium.com/ml2vec/intro-to-pytorch-with-image-classification-on-a-fashion-clothes-dataset-e589682df0c5

Later attempts adapted from fast.ai v3 lessons

Merged the train & test datasets & labels so the labels are the first column and the sets are 785 columns wide.
